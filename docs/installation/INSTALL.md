## Installation

We offer several ways to install InvokeAI, each one suited to your
experience and preferences.

1. [InvokeAI installer](INSTALL_INVOKE.md)

    This is a an installer script that installs InvokeAI and all its
    the essential third party libraries. When a new version of
    InvokeAI is released, you will run another script to upgrade to
    the new version.

    This installer is designed for people who want the system to "just
    work", and have no interest in exploring how it works or
    contributing enhancements to the code or documentation.

2. [Source code installer](INSTALL_SOURCE.md)

    This is a script that will install InvokeAI and all its essential
    third party libraries. In contrast to the previous installer, it
    includes access to a "developer console" which will allow you to
    access experimental features on the development branch.

    This method is recommended for individuals who are wish to stay
    on the cutting edge of InvokeAI development and are not afraid
    of occasional breakage.

3. [Manual Installation](INSTALL_MANUAL.md)

    In this method you will manually run the commands needed to install
    InvokeAI and its dependencies. We offer two recipes: one suited to
    those who prefer the `conda` tool, and one suited to those who prefer
    `pip` and Python virtual environments.

    This method is recommended for users who have previously used `conda`
    or `pip` in the past, developers, and anyone who wishes to remain on
    the cutting edge of future InvokeAI development and is willing to put
    up with occasional glitches and breakage.

4. [Docker Installation](INSTALL_DOCKER.md)

    We also offer a method for creating Docker containers containing
    InvokeAI and its dependencies. This method is recommended for
    individuals with experience with Docker containers and understand
    the pluses and minuses of a container-based install.

5. [Jupyter Notebooks Installation](INSTALL_JUPYTER.md)

    This method is suitable for running InvokeAI on a Google Colab
    account. It is recommended for individuals who have previously
    worked on the Colab and are comfortable with the Jupyter notebook
    environment.
