(where the Fancy Site also links ot xD)

Maybe the most simple way to get InvokeAI running with NVIDIA CUDA will be the official
NVIDIA Container Runtime (not confirmed, but got told by a friend) that the Runtime even
works when you do not have the actual Drivers installed, since it is mounting the GPU
into the Container

### ROCm-docker

Yeah - I am sorry, but since I am not into PC-Masterrace, I had no better Idea than
looking up if there is a container runtime for ROCm as well xD

So please forgive me, but at least the page isn't empty anymore ðŸ™ˆ
